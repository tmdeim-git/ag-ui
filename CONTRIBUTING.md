## 🧑‍💻 Want to Contribute Code?

First, an important plea:
**Please PLEASE reach out to us first before starting any significant work on new or existing features.**

We love community contributions! That said, we want to make sure we're all on the same page before you start.
Investing a lot of time and effort just to find out it doesn't align with the upstream project feels awful, and we don't want that to happen.
It also helps to make sure the work you're planning isn't already in progress.

As described below, please file an issue first: https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/issues
Or, reach out to us on Discord: https://discord.gg/Jd3FzfdJa8

1. **Find Something to Work On**
   Browse open issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/issues).
   Got your own idea? Open an issue first so we can start the discussion.

2. **Ask to Be Assigned**
   Comment on the issue and tag a code owner:
   → [Code Owners](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS)

3. **Get on the Roadmap**
   Once approved, you'll be assigned the issue, and it'll get added to our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/ag-ui-protocol/projects/1).

4. **Coordinate With Others**
   - If you're collaborating or need feedback, start a thread in `#-💎-contributing` on Discord
   - Or just DM the assignee directly

5. **Open a Pull Request**
   - When you’re ready, submit your PR
   - In the description, include: `Fixes #<issue-number>`
     (This links your PR to the issue and closes it automatically)

6. **Review & Merge**
   - A maintainer will review your code and leave comments if needed
   - Once it’s approved, we’ll merge it and move the issue to “done.”

**NOTE:** All community integrations (ie, .NET, Golang SDK, etc.) will need to be maintained by the community

## 📝 Want to Contribute to the Docs?

Docs are part of the codebase and super valuable—thanks for helping improve them!

Here’s how to contribute:

1. **Open an Issue First**
   - Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/issues) describing what you’d like to update or add.
   - Then comment and ask to be assigned.

2. **Submit a PR**
   - Once assigned, make your edits and open a pull request.
   - In the description, include: `Fixes #<issue-number>`
     (This links your PR to the issue and closes it automatically)

   - A maintainer will review it and merge if it looks good.

That’s it! Simple and appreciated.

That's what the demo is about ;) When asked to find available desks for an engineer, there are three desks available: A, B and C. Table A Seat 2 is taken by Alice Williams. Seat 1 is available. Table B Seat 1 is taken by Bob Smith. Seat 2 is also taken by Greg Brown. Table C Seat 1 is taken by Susanne Torelli. Seat 2 is available.

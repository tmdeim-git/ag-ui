# ag-ui-core


The Agent User Interaction Protocol SDK uses a streaming event-based
architecture with strongly typed data structures. This package provides the
foundation for connecting to agent systems.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.ag-ui</groupId>
  <artifactId>core</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

## Types

Core data structures that represent the building blocks of the system:

- RunAgentInput — Input parameters for running agents
- Message — User/assistant communication and tool usage
- Context — Contextual information provided to agents
- Tool — Defines functions that agents can call
- State — Agent state management

## Events

Events that power communication between agents and frontends:

- Lifecycle Events — Run and step tracking
- Text Message Events — Assistant message streaming
- Tool Call Events — Function call lifecycle
- State Management Events — Agent state updates
- Special Events — Raw and custom events
